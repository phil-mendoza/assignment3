# Assignment 3
### Social Networks

In Assignment 3 we will again be looking at some interaction data from students commenting on a class video. The file "comment-data.csv" shows which student responded to which student in an online video platform.

We will be using the "igraph" package to visualize the relationships between students as a network. You can read more about igraph [here](http://igraph.org/r/).

The instructions to Assignment 3 are in the Assignment 3.Rmd file. Assignments are structured in three parts, in the first part you can just follow along with the code, in the second part you will need to apply the code, and in the third part is completely freestyle and you are expected to apply your new knowledge in a new way. 

**Please complete as much as you can by midnight EDT, 10/21/20**

Once you have finished, commit, push and pull your assignment back to the main branch. Include the .Rmd file and the .html file generated from your .Rmd file.

Good luck!
